# Equity Execution Risk Modelling | Volatility-Based Signal System

A quantitative risk research project simulating front-office use of rolling volatility signals, tail diagnostics, and execution-aware risk controls, aligned with Basel standards and built using AR-GARCH pipelines.

## Objective

This project replicates how a quant execution team or risk strategist might enhance real-time risk oversight by building volatility-forecasting engines, early-warning flags, and scenario-tested control systems, enabling smarter execution decisions under shifting risk regimes.

## Problem Context

In high-frequency and intraday equity trading environments, real-time risk control cannot rely solely on historical averages. This model suite aims to:

- Forecast volatility forward-looking using AR-GARCH
- Simulate extreme downside shocks through Monte Carlo
- Quantify VaR and ES confidence bands to support trade decisions
- Design early-warning flags from dynamic volatility signals
- Bridge model outputs with real-time trade control infrastructure

## Key Components

- **AR(6)-GARCH(3,7) Forecasting Engine**  
  Captures short-term memory in returns and time-varying conditional volatility, producing rolling forecasts used to power downstream risk controls.

- **Tail Risk Diagnostics**  
  Monte Carlo stress tests on GARCH residuals, enabling scenario analysis of large drawdowns and offering quantified downside exposure estimates.

- **VaR / Expected Shortfall Bands**  
  Multi-interval estimations for Basel-aligned confidence levels (95%, 99%), applied to track order risk and trade envelope sizing.

- **Execution-Grade Risk Flags**  
  Designed logic for triggering early-warning signals under volatility spikes, supporting discretionary desks and algo controllers.

- **Python Automation & Reporting Stack**  
  Fully automated pipeline using `arch`, `statsmodels`, `plotly`, with reporting-ready outputs for daily dashboards and live decision support.

## Technologies

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `arch`, `statsmodels`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`  
- **Models & Methods**:
  - AR-GARCH (custom orders)
  - Monte Carlo simulation
  - Rolling forecast logic
  - VaR / ES under non-iid returns
  - Signal threshold calibration


## Impact Simulation

This project mirrors how a trading firm might:

- Replace backward-looking volatility with real-time rolling risk
- Strengthen pre-trade checks with execution-aware signal overlays
- Align internal controls with regulatory stress metrics
- Build scalable volatility infrastructure for use across equity books

This project is part of a broader effort to simulate professional quant workflows, from signal discovery to risk overlay design, in environments where real-time risk visibility drives execution quality and performance protection.
